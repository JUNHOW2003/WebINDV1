      <h3>My Dream Career: Photographer</h3>
      <p>As a university student passionate about photography, I see the world not just as it is, but as it could be captured through the lens. Every photo has the potential to tell a 	 story, evoke emotion, and preserve a moment that might otherwise be forgotten. Photography to me, is more than a hobby — it's a form of expression, a way to connect with people, 	 and a tool to share perspectives that words sometimes can't capture.</p>
      <p>I am inspired by the power of visual storytelling and the way a single image can spark change or create lasting impact. My goal is to grow into a skilled and thoughtful 	 	 photographer whose work not only reflects technical ability, but also heart, meaning, and purpose. I aim to document life, culture, and emotion in ways that move people and make 	 them see the world through a different lens.</p>
